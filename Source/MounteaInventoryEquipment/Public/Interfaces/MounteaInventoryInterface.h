/**
 * Mountea Inventory Interface.
 *
 * Provides functions to manage Inventory, for example:
 * * Provide info about Inventory content
 * * Add new Items
 * * Remove Items
 * * Request Item Actions
 *
 * Inventory is player-specific and thus should be attached to Player Controller.
 * If player inventory is tied to Player pawn (if player dies, his loot stays on his corpse), then use Player Pawn instead.
